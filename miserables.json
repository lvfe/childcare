Up to this September it only required one of us - so we could split the week and start work at 9.30 if bringing kids to school. My son started secondary school in September and it requires us both going to 2 diffeent schools/areas. We have been able to share lifts with other families. I bring my daughter 3 days a week, her friends family bring her 2 days a week. My husband goes 1-4 times a week as we share with 2 other families. There is an adjustment at all stages.
